## Introduction:

The Accounting Database is a custom software designed to aid companies in their daily workflow by providing a centralized platform where they can manage their clients and their respective information. This software offers an efficient and user-friendly interface to quickly access and manage client data, reducing time spent on manual tasks and minimizing the chances of human error.
Motivation
This software was created to address the problems faced by companies in managing their client information. With the increasing workload and tight deadlines, employees were struggling to manage the vast amount of data scattered across different files and folders. The Accounting Database was created to provide a solution to this problem by providing a centralized platform to store and access client data.

## Problem Solved:
The Accounting Database was designed to solve the workflow inefficiencies faced by employees in an accounting business. The use of traditional methods, such as utilizing excel sheets to manage customer data, resulted in an overwhelming amount of work within a short period of time before deadlines. This made it difficult for employees to keep track of all customer information scattered across different files and folders. The Accounting Database provides a centralized solution to store all customer information, enabling quick and easy access to all necessary information about each client and facilitating modifications in a seamless manner.

## What was Learned:
This project served as an opportunity to learn about several programming technologies, including SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Working with data tables was a valuable experience, as was learning how to use them to store and retrieve data in an efficient and user-friendly manner. The CSS skills learned in this project allowed for the customization and organization of buttons and sections, while the SQL skills focused on inserting, updating, and removing data using the database tables. The Javascript and PHP skills were utilized to create specific functions and methods required to solve problems, such as the creation of a notification system for expired cards or a relocalization function. The HTML skills were honed to define the page body and navigation bar, making it easier to search for data and improve the overall user experience.

## What makes the project stand out:
This software was custom-made, taking into account all the requests made by every employee, ensuring that their daily workflow is as efficient as possible.
The database actions and search functions were implemented based on employee suggestions, providing a higher quality of life for their workflow.
The tables in the database and the webpage structure were designed specifically to meet the needs of the company's daily work, making their workflow even easier.
